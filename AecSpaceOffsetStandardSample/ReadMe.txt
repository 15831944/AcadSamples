C# Sample - AecSpaceOffsetStandardSample

This sample demonstrates the use of the AutoCAD Architecture .NET API support
for Space Offset Rules.


Getting Started

Load and build the project file AecSpaceOffsetStandardSample.csproj in Microsoft 
Visual Studio 2008. You can build the Release and/or the Debug configuration. 

The targte is to place the file into the <root>\Space Calculation Standards
directory, which will allow the standard to work immediately after compilation 
and restarting AutoCAD Architecture.


Usage

Once the sample standard is placed in the <root>\Space Calculation Standards
(the default build location), start AutoCAD Architecture and go into the
Options dialog. Select the AEC Object Settings tab, and the Calculation
Standard drop down box should show the new "Sample Standard".
